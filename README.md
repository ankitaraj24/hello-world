# Plaintext-and-FOSS

  This project is a simple demonstration of how to use Python to retrieve two inputs and combine them and output a sentence.

# Getting Started

  In this project, you will ask the user for their name using an input command, and then, in the next line you will ask them for their age using the same     command. Finally, in the last line you will write a print statement which outputs a sentence stating the user's name and age.
  
  This project was created to teach people how to use the input command in Python. It is useful to learn this command because it is used heavily for user interaction with the program.
